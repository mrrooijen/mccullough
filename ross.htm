<i><font size="1">Probable portrait Mary Ross (r)</font></i></p>
<p><i><span lang="en-us"><font size="2">Mary</font></span><font size="2"> Ross McCullough</font></i></p>
<p><i><font size="2">drawing from a tintype, ca. 1850</font></i></p>
<p><span lang="en-us">Mary Ross is one of the ancestors who have sent many 
McCullough researchers off on a wild goose chase. I had worked out a nice 
theory, when I discovered some family papers and pictures that gave a completely 
new perspective. However, we still don't know the whole story.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span lang="en-us">What we do know is that the wedding of Mary and Sheridan 
was reported to be one of the largest ever held in Centre County until that 
time.&nbsp; Mary was also credited with &quot;being of uncommon intelligence&quot; and 
very witty.</span></p>
<p><span lang="en-us">A story on her descendants states that she was &quot;a lineal 
descendent of Betsy Ross, who made the first American flag&quot;.&nbsp; This, 
however, is not true, since, as far as we know, Betsy never had any children by 
her Ross husband, who died before Mary was born.&nbsp; Still, there is probably 
a link to that Ross family.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span lang="en-us">Recently, I found some family papers which led to a 
marriage record for a Jonothan Ross and Mary McCalmont in Centre Co., PA. It 
would appear that these two are Mary's parents. Jonothan now becomes the 
mystery. There is also one other Ross in Centre Co. at this time, an older Mary 
Ross, head of household, with several children, who first shows up in the census 
record for London Grove, near Philadelphia, in 1800. It would be surprising if 
there were no connection between this Mary and Jonothan. This second Mary is, in 
turn, in the same place at more or less the same time as Betsy Ross' father in 
law. It is possible that her Ross husband and Jonothan were brothers or even 
theoretically possible that she was Jonothan's mother.</span></p>
<p><span lang="en-us">Any and all ideas greatly appreciated!</span></p>
