<h2><span lang="en-us"><font size="5">Was James and not Hugh the father of 
William McCullough?</font></span></h2>
<p><span lang="en-us">Just when you think you have it all figured out... some 
new info comes along and confuses everything! Thanks to the efforts of the 
Cox-Hull family, I have just received some new McCullough info that I summarize 
below and which casts some doubt on the accuracy of the &quot;Remarkable Family&quot; 
article.<br>
<br>
To recap: In the 1911 article <a href="images/a_remarkable_familyBW.jpg">&quot;A Remarkable Family&quot;</a> Hugh is said to be the 
father of known ancestor William, older brothers John and Archibald, and sister 
Mary/Polly, who is said to have married John Hull who earned a gold medal in the 
War of 1812, still in the possession of the family.<br>
<br>
I have spent some time trying to verify this, with little/mixed success. What I 
thought&nbsp; I had more or less proven via documents or other records was that 
William married Rachel Sheridine on Feb. 4, 1796 in Harford Co., MD. The first 
census record I definitely have for them is in 1820 in Centre Co., and shows 2 
sons and no daughters. By 1830, Sheridan was married and had left for Western PA 
and the only McCullough in Walker Twp. (and who was also in the same proximity 
to the names of the 1820 census) was James (so I assumed, older brother of 
Sheridan) who also had an older man in the household, whom I took to be father 
William. Sheridan and his children in later census records and in other records 
always consistently report that he was born in Baltimore.<br>
<br>
The new info from the Cox-Hull family is based in part on a letter written in 
1930 from a man then 88, which gets us back pretty far. It also mentions things 
his grandmother said about aunts who were presumably a generation older, going 
back to the time of Mary McCullough or even Rachel Sheridine. Anyway, according 
to this story, <i><b>Mary was not William's sister, but daughter, and born in 
1794 in York, PA</b></i>. She married John Lewis Hull in 1814, which would 
explain why she doesn't show up on the 1820 census in William's household. I 
have found an 1830 census record for them in Lamar, Centre Co., but haven't had 
time to search for one from 1820 yet. The letter also repeats the war story 
mentioned in the McCullough article, so it is obviously the same Mary 
McCullough. <br>
<br>
Some conflicts with the currently accepted family tradition:<br>
&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
  <li><span lang="en-us">Quick census searches support both the <i><b>date and 
  place of Mary's birth: York, PA and before the marriage of Rachel &amp; William in 
  1796</b></i>. How could this be, if they were married in MD and also Sheridan 
  is said to have been born in Maryland? They were (if in Harford, not 
  Baltimore) close to the border, it's true. But strange that one child would be 
  PA and then the next in Baltimore. A possibility is that Rachel Sheridine was 
  William's second wife. Since he would have been 28 at the time of that 
  marriage, this is quite possible. </span>
  <p>&nbsp;</li>
  <li><span lang="en-us">The <i><b>first Hull daughter was named Rachel 
  Sheridine Hull and the second son, William McCullough Hull</b></i>. Following 
  naming traditions, this leaves little room for doubt that she was a daughter 
  of William &amp; Rachel. Other children were iii. Rebecca McCullough Hull, and 
  Thomas Allen, Elizabeth Ann, Sanford W. and Mary Jane. McCullough as middle 
  name also shows up in later generations. Still, strange that the collective 
  children of Sheridan would not know that John Hull was Sheridan's 
  brother-in-law instead of uncle. Actually, I find it strange that with all the 
  things written about Sheridan, there is never a mention of a brother or 
  sister. Finding father William's will would certainly be a help here! Again, 
  the above possibility that William had two wives could help. If Mary was 
  Sheridan's step-sister and seven years older, he (or his descendants) may have 
  thought of her more as an aunt. If Rachel was the second wife, he still 
  married her when Mary was very young, under two years old, so it is not so 
  strange that she would name her daughter after her step mother instead of a 
  mother she never knew, particularly since Rachel was still alive at the time.<br>
&nbsp;</span></li>
  <li><span lang="en-us">In the 1880 census, <i><b>Mary's parents (and also 
  Mary) are listed as both being born in PA</b></i>, though we are pretty sure 
  that both William &amp; Rachel Sheridine were born in Maryland. In the same 
  census, Sheridan lists his and his mother's birthplace as MD but his father as 
  PA. This tends to support the above step-mother theory.<br>
&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span lang="en-us">In addition:<br>
&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
  <li><span lang="en-us">According to the letter, <i><b>William was the son of a 
  James McCullough, not Hugh</b></i>, who came from Ireland as a boy, and was 
  married to a Nancy Weldon, of English descent and who (or her father, it says) 
  came from London during the &quot;London Plague&quot;. Since William (b. 1768) is said 
  to have had older brothers who were old enough to fight in the Revolution, 
  this puts a likely birth date for his father at 1725-45. </span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li><span lang="en-us">There is also a curious paragraph in which the writer 
  tells that his grandmother told of two maiden aunts (this would have been at 
  the beginning of the 1800's) telling stories that the McCulloughs were related 
  to Mary, Queen of Scots, and he asks his relative if she know the background 
  of this claim. This is a story I have also heard in our family, a completely 
  different branch.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li><span lang="en-us">The letter also relates a story of a McCullough wounded 
  or killed in the battle of Brandywine and asks what the connection was. There 
  are many James who served in the revolution, including one who took his oath 
  near Elkton MD (where the British landed for the battle) and is buried in the 
  Brandywine Cemetery near Wilmington. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span lang="en-us"><br>
I have also found many more James than Hughs, including two James H. (Hugh??) 
McCulloughs from the 1700's mostly from near Philadelphia/Chester, I believe, 
although the younger James was a collector for the port of Baltimore around 
1800. One of them had a son named Hugh, so it is quite possible that the H stood 
for Hugh. There is also a quite prominent pair of brothers named James and Hugh 
in the Philadelphia/Chester area between 1730 and 1760 or so -- may be some 
connection. I wish I only knew what.<br>
<br>
I have also found a couple of church records (baptisms) in Muddy Creek, 
Presbyterian Church, York Co., for McCullough children who are listed as being 
born in Harford (parent in this case John -- who, I was hoping until I received 
the Hull info -- was the long lost brother of William! Could still be the case, 
of course). It does indicate that there was a lot of border crossing in the 
area, even for Sunday church, apparently.<br>
<br>
I have done a few hours on the James idea, but found nothing conclusive. 
William's and Sheridan's children's names don't help either, since Rachel 
Sheridine's father was quite likely James also. I have always thought it strange 
that there was never a Hugh (as far as I know) in the first few generations of 
descendants, and so had thought that Hugh could have been a middle name or short 
for something else. </span></p>
<p><span lang="en-us">I will continue to research this line of thought and hope 
that with the collective info of everyone, this might jog a memory of something 
someone else has run into. If so, please let me know!</span><br>
