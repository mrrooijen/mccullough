1781 which includes the following physical description: "5'8" tall, black hair,

Hays' son Thomas Hays, served in the Civil War, and her daughter-in-law Keziah 
Foster Hays also played a role in the Civil War, when she and some classmates 
made a <a href="images/flag.jpg">flag</a> that was carried throughout the Civil 
War by some local boys, and kept with them, concealed, even while in Confederate 
prison. This flag was presented by Keziah & Deborah Jane's son, Thomas Hays to 
the Soldiers & Sailors Memorial Hall in Pittsburgh, PA in 1912.</span></p>

Loughinsholin, Londonderry, Ireland; died 18 June 1835 in East Franklin, 
Armstrong Co., PA. He was the son of <b>8. Andrew MACKEY </p>

<p>Please note: any McKee-Mackay ancestry beyond this point is based on limited research so far, family trees of others and is NOT proven. Use it as a starting point. Andrew was in any case in America by 1766 when he is named in land warrants along with William & John Mckee. He named his first male children William & John. I also have a will for John McKie from about 1712 in Scotland, naming a son John. Based on this, I now consider it more likely that in contrast to what is below, Andrew, William & John were the sons of the John McKie mentioned below as eldest son of John McKie & Esther Hawthorne, and not of Andrew, a younger brother. The elder John is likely the one who died in 1712 and his son John died in 1765, which could have been the point at which Andrew, William & John immigrated. It is of course possible that Andrew was the son of the younger brother Andrew, but we would then have expected him to name his 1st or 2nd son Andrew, not his 5th son </b>.</p>
