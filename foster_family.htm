        <p><a name="Robert Morrison bio">Robert Morrison</a> (grandson of Robert 
        Morrison and Elizabeth Culbertson, b. March 15, 1822, m. Flora Bomberger) 
        in his auto-biography, published in &quot;The Scroll&quot; for April, 1897, page 
        411, says:<br>
        <br>
        &quot;Robert Morrison, my grandfather, was of Scotch-Irish parentage. He was 
        born in County Derry, Ireland. The family was of the middle class, 
        neither poor nor rich, and was connected in marriage with the Hamiltons 
        in Scotland. In 1765, when Robert was sixteen years old, with his 
        brothers older than himself, he came to America and settled in Delaware. 
        Some of them emigrated to the Valley of Virginia; one kept on south; 
        another wing went west to Vincennes, Kaskasia and St. Louis.<br>
        <br>
        &quot;After the Revolutionary War, in which Robert had a share as one of the 
        'blue hen's chickens,' as soldiers from Delaware were called, he 
        concluded to take his young wife, Elizabeth Culbertson, an English 
        woman, and two little children, as I believe, and go west. General 
        Washington asked him to take his tract of 600 acres in the north western 
        part of Fayette County, Pa., lying on the Youghiogheny river. He went 
        and looked at the land, but thought it too much exposed to incursions 
        from the Indians, and continued his journey about fifty miles southwest 
        into Green county, and bought out the McClungs, who took their slaves 
        and went to Kentucky, as Pennsylvania had in 1780 passed an ordinance of 
        gradual emancipation. There my grandfather lived and reared a family of 
        ten children and died at the age of eighty-two. There my father, Thomas 
        Morrison (brother of William Morrison), was born and reared.&quot;</p>
