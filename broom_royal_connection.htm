<h3><span lang="en-us">Mystery 1: Who were the ancestors of Thomas Broom, b. 
circa 1688? </span></h3>

<p><span lang="en-us">The earliest Broom in our line for whom we have a record  in America was 
<a href="broom_family.htm">Thomas Broom</a>, 
grandfather of <a href="Jacob_Broom.htm">Jacob Broom</a>, delegate to the 
Constitutional Convention from Delaware. The first record found so far for 
Thomas is of Thomas' marriage to Elizabeth Hannum in 1711 at St. Paul's Church, 
Chester Co., PA. Thomas is also listed as a taxpayer in 1715 in both Darby and 
Concord, PA. He then appears in Wilmington in 1729 and 1730, in records of the 
Old Swedes Church. After this, the family is fairly well documented. </span></p>

<p><span lang="en-us">In all biographies of this branch, there are references to 
the Broom/Broome/Brome families of PA, DE, NY and MD being connected to one 
another, but no one explains just how. I show various descendants of Thomas 
moving to these states, but cannot tie him to parents or a birthplace.</span><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 10.0pt">
</span><span lang="EN-GB">There is a record for the marriage of Ann Broom to 
Nathaniel Tucker at the same church where Thomas was also married six years 
later. It is a reasonable assumption that she was his sister or at least a 
relative. A James Broom, son of Francis, came from England to Philadelphia in 
1717, the same year that a William and (another?) Thomas show up in a 
Philadelphia list. There is also a Daniel around this time that I have been 
unable to connect. Some researchers think James &amp; Thomas are related. It is 
quite probable that there is some connection between all of these persons...&nbsp; 
but what??? </span></p>

<p><span lang="en-gb">There has also been some data to indicate that Thomas may 
have come to PA via Barbados or another Caribbean island. </span>
<span lang="EN-GB">Any ideas??? <a href="mailto:info@mccullough.nl">E-mail</a></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">Nearly all biographies also 
spend considerable time on the &quot;Royal Connection&quot;, which is generally presumed 
to derive from the name Broom and the connection of this plant to the 
Plantegenet family. However, I have still not found a convincing genealogy 
making the link. Any information on this subject would be appreciated! </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">On the other hand, there is 
quite a bit of information linking the ancestors of Jacob Broom's mother Esther 
Willis, via her great grandmother, <a href="brinton_family.htm">Ann Bagley 
Brinton</a>, to this very family. </p>
