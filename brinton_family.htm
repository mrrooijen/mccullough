daughter of William Brinton &amp; Ann Bagley, was the great-grandmother of 
<a href="Jacob_Broom.htm">Jacob Broom</a></i></font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span lang="en-us">The Brintons and Bagleys were Quakers who immigrated to America from 
Staffordshire Co., England. In 1659 in England, <a href="brinton_family.htm#William Brinton">William 
Brinton</a> married 
<a href="brinton_family.htm#Ann Bagley,">Ann Bagley</a>. They 
are known to have had five children (3 girls, <a href="brinton_family.htm#Esther Brinton">Esther</a>, Ann &amp; Elizabeth, and 2 
boys, William &amp; Edward) between the years 1660 and 1675, but one son, Edward 
Brinton, died at an early age. </span></p>
<p><span lang="en-us">Ann's brother, Edward Bagley, has also become the subject 
of much recent
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.blackcountrysociety.co.uk/articles/bagley.htm">
research</a>, as he was mentioned as a &quot;kinsman&quot; and named as executor of Lady 
Elizabeth Bernard's will. Lady Bernard was Shakespeare's granddaughter and last 
surviving direct descendant, and Edward could very well have ended up with Lady 
Bernard's (and by extension, Shakespeare's) papers. Unfortunately, the nature of 
the connection between the Bagley's and the Shakespeare family has not yet been 
conclusively determined, and so it is not yet possible to say if this connection 
also applied to Ann Bagley Brinton. However, the research article by
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.blackcountrysociety.co.uk/articles/bagley.htm#note">
John Taplin</a> gives at the very least some interesting insights into life and 
social relationships in the Brinton's hometown area in the 1500 and 1600's. I 
will be traveling to Sedgeley in the coming months and hope&nbsp; to be able to 
publish some new insights into the English history of these families in the near 
future.</span></p>
<h3><span lang="en-us">Early years in America</span></h3>
<p><span lang="en-us">Returning to the Brintons in America: in an effort to 
escape religious persecution, William Sr. came to America in the spring of 1684 
with his wife and his only living son, William. The family settled near what is now New Castle, 
Delaware, and is reputed to have lived in a cave throughout the first winter. They survived thanks 
to gifts of game supplied by the Indians that traversed the route by their 
shelter. Once the weather cleared, William built the family a log cabin and 
planted a pear tree as a symbol of a fruitful future. He purchased 50 acres from 
Thomas King in March of 1686 and 450 acres in Oct. of that same year in 
Birmingham. These purchases included the lands on which he was already living. 
In 1688 he purchased an additional 400 acres. </span></p>
<p><span lang="en-us">Several years later, the son 
William , built the William Brinton 1704 House pictured above on an adjoining 
part of this land. William Sr. and Ann had originally left their three daughters 
Ann, Elizabeth, and <a href="brinton_family.htm#Esther Brinton">Esther</a> behind in England, but 
eventually these children and their husbands also emigrated to this area. </span></p>
<p><span lang="en-us">As Quakers, William and Ann had lost much of what they owned to the British 
government. William was again on the unpopular side of religion within seven years of 
coming to America as he joined up with the rebellious Quaker, George Keith. This 
group fractured and broke up after a few years, at which point William and 
family returned to the Orthodox Quaker church where they were members in good 
standing at Concord Monthly Meeting at the time of their deaths, shortly after 
one another. A
<a href="images/ABBweb.jpg">biography of Ann</a>, written in part by her husband 
William, was reprinted in &quot;The Friend&quot;, Vol 33, a Quaker publication.</span></p>
<h3><span lang="en-us">Nieces and granddaughters, nephews and grandsons...</span></h3>
<h4><span lang="en-us">Although a matter of much discussion, based on the 
available evidence, it is considered probable, but not definitely proven, that Ann Bagley can trace her ancestry back to the Plantagenet family, 
including <a href="brinton_family.htm#Henry II Plantagenet King Of ENGLAND">King Henry II</a> and 
Eleanor of Aquitaine, as well as many other colorful characters, including
<a href="brinton_family.htm#Edward I Longshanks King Of ENGLAND">Edward I</a>,
<a href="brinton_family.htm#Edward II King Of ENGLAND">II</a>,<a href="brinton_family.htm#Edward III King Of England"> 
III</a>, and <a href="brinton_family.htm#Philippe III King Of FRANCE">Philippe III</a> and
<a href="brinton_family.htm#Philippe IV King Of FRANCE,">IV</a> of France. I have spent many hours 
trying to decipher as many original documents as possible (see below), but the 
&quot;proof&quot; either way has not been found as yet. </span></h4>
<p><span lang="en-us">Until a few years ago, this connection had been assumed to 
be sufficiently &quot;proven&quot; in professional genealogists' circles, but then a 
document was discovered in which a Latin phrase was used which was translated as 
&quot;nephew&quot;. In this case, if nephew were the correct relationship to the person in 
question (again, see <a href="brinton_family.htm#Please_note">below</a> if you're really 
interested in this story!), then the lineal connection to royalty becomes 
uncertain. However, the experts seem divided on this question, as the 
alternative, literal translation is &quot;descended through the mother&quot;, or lineal 
descendant. Interestingly enough, in helping Mr. Taplin with his 
Bagley-Shakespeare research, I was reading Shakespeare's will, written just a 
few years before the citation I mention. In it, he refers in English to his 
granddaughter as his niece! Who was it that wrote &quot;What's in a name?&quot;...</span></p>
<p><span lang="en-us">The Brintons and Bagleys tie into our family through 
Esther Brinton, William and Ann's daughter, who married John Willis. Their 
granddaughter Esther Willis married <a href="broom_family.htm">James Broom</a>, 
and they became the parents of <a href="Jacob_Broom.htm">Jacob Broom</a>, 
delegate to the Constitutional Convention from Delaware. Many of the Broom 
descendants were active in

<p><span lang="en-us"><i><a name="Please_note">Please note</a>: the above is speculation based on a wealth 
of circumstantial evidence, but has not yet been definitely proven or disproven 
from documents of that time, and may never be. I have spent several hours on 
this question and am currently gathering as many original documents as possible. 
I will try to post the whole story in my Mysteries section this Fall, but 
briefly: what was generally considered fact (the above) was thrown out the 
window in 1996 by Chas. Hansen when <a name="he discovered">he discovered</a> a
<a href="images/tomlinson-1.jpg">reference to Edward Bagley's relation to 
Elizabeth Tomlinson</a> (image courtesy of Linda J. Coate) as &quot;nepoti() ex 
matre&quot;, which he translated as nephew. In Classical Latin, this was grandson, 
but in Medieval Latin, could have been either. There are at least two experts on 
both sides of this question. More interesting is that the clerk originally wrote 
&quot;son&quot; followed by some words I have not been able to decipher, and then crossed 
this out. On top of this, anyone who has worked with this sort of records knows 
how many mistakes they contain. Even if nephew was correct, there are at least 
two plausible theories that still connect Edward to Sutton, including the sister 
theory. Facts are (among many others too numerous to go into now) that John 
Bagley, after his marriage to the supposed Sutton child,&nbsp; was a Deerkeeper 
on Suttons estate and later managed the estate in place of one of the sons, that 
John was treated by Sutton equally with many of his other (illegitimate) sons 
(in law) in many documents &amp; dealings, that Edward Bagley was named 
administrator of Elizabeth's estate, that Elizabeth left as many bequests to the 
Bagleys as to her other (proven) children, even giving John Jr. a house when he 
married, and that one of her sons contested this will, claiming that Sutton had 
influenced the bequests to the Bagleys. Also, John &amp; wife named their first 
child Edward, and others Dudley and Elizabeth. Edward named one of his sons 
Sutton. It has been claimed that the Bagleys received more than Elizabeth's 
other children because these other children were otherwise taken care of. I now 
have copies of the original wills of some of these children as well as that of 
John (<a href="images/Johnweb.jpg">above</a>). My preliminary conclusion is that 
John had nearly as much, if not more, to bequeath than some of the other 
&quot;children&quot;.&nbsp; Loyal &quot;servant&quot; or son in law? We may never know. However, in 
my story based on what I know so far, the son-in-law theory rates a &quot;more likely 
than not&quot;! So to continue...</i></span></p>
