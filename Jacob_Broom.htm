<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Arial">Jacob Broom 
is most frequently remembered as one of the signers of the US Constitution. 
However, this event encompassed only a few short months of his 58 years. Because 
of the various roles he played in business, and in national, state and local 
politics, more information on Jacob has survived the past 200-250 years than 
might be expected for the average citizen of the 18<sup>th</sup> century. This 
story is a modest attempt to get further than the Constitution and look at the 
person and family of Jacob Broom.</span></p>

<h3><span lang="EN-GB">Jacob Broom's parents</span></h3>
<p><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Arial">
<img border="0" src="brecksmill.jpg" width="150" height="105" align="left" vspace="10">Jacob 
Broom was born in Wilmington in the summer or fall of 1752, probably October 17<sup>th</sup> 
according to a marriage record. His parents were James Broom and Esther Willis. 
James is often referred to as a “gentleman” and as a “blacksmith turned 
farmer”.  Certainly by the time of his death, he possessed quite a bit of 
property, including significant acreage, some of it under cultivation, but farming or blacksmithing 
was certainly not his only form of livelihood. On the 
contrary, during Jacob’s early years, James, like his father before him, placed 
advertisements in the local papers indicating that he owned and operated a 
tavern providing “entertainment for man & horse”. He was also involved in buying 
and selling land, an interest that he passed on to son Jacob.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Arial">Esther 
Willis’ parents and grandparents were members of the Society of Friends, and 
were some of the earliest settlers of SE Pennsylvania. James and his parents, 
however, had been members of St. Paul’s in Chester, although James’ mother was 
originally a Quaker. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Arial">Grandfather 
Thomas Broom moved to Wilmington in the late 1720’s or early 1730’s and it is 
likely, but not certain, that James moved there with him at that time. James 
could have remained behind, certainly if he had been serving an apprenticeship 
with one of his neighbours in the Concord area. Esther was still living in 
Thornbury at the time of her marriage, raising an interesting point in itself:  
exactly when did Jacob’s parents marry?</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Arial">The most 
often-quoted story places their marriage in 1750, and names Jacob as the oldest 
child. However, Esther’s mother wrote her will in 1743, and left a bequest to 
John Broom, son of Esther and James. This means that their marriage most likely 
took place in 1740, and John was probably born in 1741 or 1742, possibly in 
Pennsylvania instead of Delaware. Was John still alive when Jacob was born? 
Unfortunately, there seem to be no birth or death records for <i>any</i> of 
James’ and Esther’s children, perhaps a result of their “mixed” marriage.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Arial">We then seem 
to have a 10 year gap before Jacob’s birth, very unusual in those times. 
Grandfather Thomas Broom does not mention any grandchildren through James in his 
will in 1749, although he does mention some of his other grandchildren. In 1759, 
Jacob Taylor mentions “friends Esther, Jacob, Isaac, and Abraham Broom” in his 
will and makes James his executor. While this Esther could be either mother 
Esther or a daughter of the same name, the will suggests a son Isaac, born in 
between Jacob and Abraham. There was no mention of a John, suggesting that he 
had died prior to 1759. By the time James died in 1794, it would appear that 
only Jacob and Abraham were still alive. Alternatively, there could have been a 
split in the family, perhaps along religious lines. An Isaac Broom, not a 
particularly common name at that time, is mentioned in the1790 Bucks County 
census. However, no connection with James Broom has been proven or disproved as 
yet.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
<h3><span lang="EN-GB">Early life in Wilmington</span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family: Arial"><a href="DSC02429.jpg"><img border="0" src="DSC02429_small.jpg" xthumbnail-orig-image="DSC02429.jpg" align="right"></a></span></h3>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Arial">Back to 
Jacob. We will perhaps never know for sure if there were several or only two 
children in the Broom family in the 1750’s. However, by the time Jacob was born, 
the family was definitely living in Wilmington. James had placed several ads 
offering his deceased father and mother’s property for sale in 1750 and 1751. It 
is not clear if he resided on Market St. himself at that time. By the late 
1750’s, however, the family was most definitely living in that area and running 
a tavern, described in an advertisement by James (in the 3<sup>rd</sup> person) 
as a new “</span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family: Arial">three Story 
House, below the lower Market house, at the Sign of the Sloop, where he 
continues to keep Entertainment for Man and Horse, as usual, and requests his 
Friends, and others, to favour him with their Custom”.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Arial">In 1757, when 
Jacob was 5, Abraham 2 and perhaps other children still alive, James also 
advertises that a servant girl, a recent arrival from Ireland, had run away. Her 
description creates a vivid picture: “</span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family: Arial">a 
short thick chunky Girl, and had on when she went away, a striped Calicoe Gown, 
with Shells between the Stripes; also a striped Linen Gown, and a Linsey 
Petticoat, striped yellow and black, and a brown Linsey Ditto, white Yarn 
Stockings, and old Shoes, without Buckles</span><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Arial">.“
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Arial">This and the 
other ads placed between 1750 and 1771 for lost & found horses and meetings to 
be held at the Broom house or tavern, paint a picture of a lively, bustling 
house, with travellers and other customers coming and going at all hours.  We 
can almost see a very young Jacob peering out from behind the skirts of the 
domestic servants, not missing a thing.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-family: Arial" lang="en-gb">Jacob as a young adult</span></h3>
<p><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Arial">Jacob was most likely educated 
at home for the first few years. He entered the Old Academy around 1765. There 
he studied surveying, apparently completing his courses successfully around the 
spring of 1772. At the end of May of that year, he advertised himself to be open 
for business as “Jacob Broom, </span>
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-family: Arial">SURVEYOR and CONVEYANCER, at his 
Office the Corner of Market street and Third Street, in the Borough of 
Wilmington, and opposite David Bush, Esquire.” </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family: Arial">He continued: “TAKES this 
Method to acquaint the Public, that he was regularly instructed in the Practice 
of Surveying and Conveyancing, and is now determined to follow it with the 
closest Application, and hopes to give general Satisfaction, to those who may be 
pleased to employ him; they may depend upon having their Business done 
authentically, and with the greatest Care, Secrecy and Dispatch. Any Person, 
wanting to place out Money at Interest, may be assured that he will procure them 
undoubted Security, be Mortgages, or otherwise. Said BROOM, upon Application, 
will peruse and examine Titles to Lands; &c. and inform the Possessor or Owner 
of the Deeds, relating to such Lands, of any Defect in their Titles, also what 
will be needful to remedy or supply such Defect.</span><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Arial"> 
“.  </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Arial">The family apparently owned a 
significant portion of the land between Front and 3<sup>rd</sup> St, bordering 
on Market, as well individual lots and land outside of the city. This quite 
likely was a portion of the property mentioned in grandfather Thomas’ will, and 
was being split up into smaller lots over time. Some was kept in the family, and 
it is here that Jacob also started his first businesses and was still living at 
the time of his father’s death. David Bush, mentioned in the ad, was in fact 
Jacob’s uncle, having married James’ sister. His location could also have been 
part of Thomas Broom’s legacy.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Arial">In 1773, 
shortly after he opened his first business on Market St., Jacob married Rachel 
Pierce. By this time, James seems to have overcome his religious dilemmas and 
was openly associated with Old Swedes Church. It is possible that Esther had 
died by this time. We do know that she was not mentioned in James’ will and so 
probably died before 1791. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Arial">Jacob’s 
children Ann (Nancy), James Madison, Esther and Sarah followed in short order as 
evidenced by a belated baptism of several of the children in 1784. This record 
also contains a note that a daughter Elizabeth had been baptized in 1777. She 
had presumably died in the meantime as another Elizabeth is baptised in 1784. 
Jacob is listed as a Vestryman of Old Swedes Church in 1784. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Arial">Children 
Jacob Pierce, Rachel Maria, Lavinia R and Nicholas Way followed between 1785 and 
1793. Of these children, Nicholas Way, who was named for James’ cousin, the well 
known doctor Nicholas Way, also probably died very young. It seems that Jacob & 
Rachel had ten children and not the eight commonly mentioned. However, only 
eight of them reached adulthood.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-family: Arial" lang="en-gb">Jacob Broom's political and 
public life including his role during the Constitutional Convention</span></h3>

alt="[Afbeelding product]" border="0" width="222" height="162" align="left" style="float: right"></a></span><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Arial">During 
this period, Jacob had not stood still in his business and political life. In 
1776, at the young age of 24, he was elected Second Burgess of Wilmington. He 
served in this function and also that of Chief Burgess several times over the 
years. During this period, his advertisements began to change accent slightly, 
placing more emphasis on securing money for mortgages and on the sale of land 
instead of his surveying business. However, Jacob did draw some of the maps used 
by George Washington in 1777 at the Battle of the Brandywine and a few other 
maps of his are reputedly still housed in various museums.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Arial">In 1783, 
Jacob was charged with writing Wilmington’s farewell to George Washington, a 
speech in which some of Jacob’s own political sentiments begin to shine through. 
He urged Washington to <span style="color:#280D0D">contribute his advice and 
influence "to promote that harmony and union of our infant governments which are 
so essential to the permanent establishment of our freedom, happiness and 
prosperity.”</span> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="en-gb"><a href="WilmCover.jpg">
<img border="0" src="WilmCover25_small.jpg" xthumbnail-orig-image="WilmCover25.jpg" align="left"></a></span><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Arial">Jacob 
also served in the State Legislature from 1784 – 6 and in 1788. In 1787, he 
signed a petition to abolish slavery, although a later census shows him to have 
had a slave in the household, in addition to several free servants.   Jacob had 
been chosen to attend the Annapolis convention, but like many, was unable to 
attend. Later, he was again selected to attend the Constitutional Convention and 
the minutes indicate that he never missed a session. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Jacob Broom was, in his mid-thirties, 
one of the youngest delegates at the Constitutional Convention. </span>
<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Arial">Jacob seems destined to be 
remembered as having played a modest role since he did not often take the 
initiative in discussions and did not often take the floor. While this is 
certainly true, a careful reading of James Madison’s notes of the convention do 
allow for some nuances. The Delaware delegates were sent with at least one 
“mission”: to ensure that the wealthier “little” states were not bereft of their 
voice in the federal government because of their smaller size. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Arial">This 
discussion went on for pages (and days) in the minutes and the weariness and 
almost hopelessness of Madison is easily read between the lines. At one point he 
describes Jacob with the following words:  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">“Mr. BROOM gave 
notice to the House, that he had concurred with a reserve to himself of an 
intention to claim for his State an equal voice in the second branch; which he 
thought could not be denied after this concession of the small States as to the 
first branch.” </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Arial">When things 
had reached a point that the larger states in particular wanted to break off 
discussions en even the Convention, Jacob voted against this and interjected:</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">“Mr. BROOM 
thought it his duty to declare his opinion against an adjournment sine die, as 
had been urged by Mr. PATTERSON such a measure, he thought, would be fatal. 
Something must be done by the Convention, though it should be a bare majority.”</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Arial">Firm words 
that also attest to a feeling for give-and-take. Somewhat later, when the point 
had been largely won, Jacob can be seen to soften his standpoint on some other 
issues in recognition of the concessions of the larger States, a capacity that 
set an example for some of the other delegates at times.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Arial">Reading these 
pages, I have formed a somewhat different picture of Jacob’s role: certainly 
modest and of someone not concerned with focussing attention on himself, but 
certainly not one of a passive spectator. On the contrary, he seems to have 
listened intently, formed his own vision, and kept quiet as long as things were 
going in the “good” direction. However, he frequently supported a speaker’s 
standpoint to give it emphasis, stated his opinion at appropriate moments in the 
discussions and did not give up on points that were important to him. At the 
same time, he showed himself to be flexible and able to find the important 
balance between the desire to win a point at all costs and to reach a goal that 
perhaps had moved a bit during the journey to reach it.</span></p>

<h3><span lang="EN-GB">CAREER AFTER THE CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION</span></h3>
<p><span lang="en-us">After the convention, Broom returned to Wilmington, where in 1795 he erected 
a home near the Brandywine River on the outskirts of the city. One of Broom's primary interests remained local government, 
however. 
In addition to continuing his service in Wilmington's government, he became the 
city's first postmaster (1790-92). </span></p>
<p><span lang="en-us">For many years, he chaired the board of directors of Wilmington's Delaware 
Bank. He also operated a cotton mill, as well as a machine shop that produced 
and repaired mill machinery. He was involved, too, in an unsuccessful scheme to 
mine bog iron ore. A further interest was internal improvements: toll roads, 
canals, and bridges. A <a href="http://www.mccullough.nl/images/broom_letter.jpg">letter
</a>to his son James in 1794 touches upon a number of these pursuits.</span></p>
<p><span lang="en-us">Broom also found time for philanthropic and religious activities. 
His long-standing affiliation with the Old Academy led him to 
become involved in its reorganization into the College of Wilmington, and to 
serve on the college's first Board of Trustees. Broom was also deeply involved 
in his community's religious affairs as a lay leader of the Old Swedes Church.
</span> </p>




<p><span lang="en-us">He died suddenly at the age of 58 in 1810 while in Philadelphia on 
business and was buried there at Christ Church Burial Ground. 
His grandson and namesake--and my gggrandfather-- Jacob Broom Lyon, was just 
three years old at the time.</span></p>
