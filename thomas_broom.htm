<h2><span lang="en-us">Thomas Broom</span></h2>
<p><span lang="en-us">
Most 
biographies of Jacob Broom report his father to have been James Broom married to 
Esther Willis, but do not mention earlier ancestors. Several internet sites and 
LDS records show James' father to be Daniel Broom, but I am quite sure this is 
incorrect.&nbsp; The following reconstructs what is known of Thomas and the 
period 1710 to 1750 from documents and records. In my opinion, there is 
sufficient evidence to show that Thomas Broom, married to Elizabeth Hannum, was 
the father of James and grandfather of Jacob Broom.</span></p>
<p><span lang="en-us"><font size="1"><i>Chester Valley</i></font></span></p>
<h3><span lang="en-us">Early Years in Chester<img border="0" src="StPauls1702-2.jpg" width="225" height="176" align="right" hspace="3" vspace="30"></span></h3>
<p><span lang="en-us">Thomas Broom is the first Broom ancestor who we can 
definitely trace in America. The earliest record found 
so far for Thomas himself is of Thomas' marriage to Elizabeth Hannum in 1711 at St. Paul's Church, 
Chester Co., PA. There is no indication that Thomas was ever a Quaker, although 
his in laws and many of the neighbors in Concord were originally Friends when 
they immigrated to Pennsylvania. However, in the 1690's a number broke off to 
follow George Keith. These “Keithians” separated from the Yearly Meeting to form 
a new group styling themselves “Christian Quakers.” This was the first rift in 
the history of the Society of Friends. George Keith was disowned by the Friends 
in 1695 and then was ordained as a Priest of the Episcopal Church in 1700. John 
Hannum was very involved in setting up St. Paul's in 1702 <font size="1"><i>(see 
illustration right)</i></font>, and it is quite likely that Thomas met 
Elizabeth after she and her family had converted to the Episcopalian faith.</span></p>
<p align="right"><span lang="en-us"><font size="1"><i>St. Pauls Church, Chester 
circa 1702</i></font></span></p>
<p><span lang="en-us">
Thomas is listed as a taxpayer in 1715 in Darby and 
also in Concord, PA together with John Hannum, his father in law. John Hannum was 
one of the earliest settlers of Chester Co., arriving in the mid 1680's. In 
1717, a Thomas Broom&nbsp; is admitted as a Freeman to the city of Philadelphia. </span></p>
<p><span lang="en-us"><a href="1740eastburn2.jpg">
<img border="0" src="1740eastburn_small1.jpg" xthumbnail-orig-image="1740eastburn2.jpg" align="left" width="125" height="162"></a>This is almost certainly &quot;our&quot; Thomas Broom, as there are no other Thomases of 
the same spelling in the area at that time. There is a Thomas Broome of another 
family, who married Elizabeth Coley, to add to the confusion.&nbsp; However, 
this Thomas consistently used the &quot;e&quot;. Our branch signed their own name without 
the &quot;e&quot; on all records we have. Now and then, there are mistakes in 
transcriptions, particularly in census records, but generally, the spelling is a 
good clue as to which family it is. </span></p>
<p><span lang="en-us">
Thomas and Elizabeth were active in the church community and from 
about 1720 to 1727, Thomas is listed as a Church Warden at St. Paul's Episcopal 
Church, together with John Hannum. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span lang="en-us">Thomas moves to Wilmington, DE<a href="IIWilmington1772-IIWilmington1772-3.jpg"><img border="0" src="IIWilmington1772-IIWilmington1772-3_small.jpg" xthumbnail-orig-image="IIWilmington1772-IIWilmington1772-3.jpg" align="right" width="250" height="197"></a></span></h3>
<p><span lang="en-us">
Shortly after that, in 1729, Thomas is listed as 
a trustee for the Old Swedes Church in Wilmington, about 15 miles from Concord. 
It is not entirely certain that he had permanently moved to Wilmington at the 
time, as there were other trustees from the Chester area, but by 1735/6, he is 
named on petitions concerning the incorporation of Wilmington and the 
organization of the market there <font size="1"><i>(see map of area right).
</i></font>By this time, it would seem that he was a property owner in 
Wilmington and permanent resident. His brother in law Robert Hannum also seems to have moved to Wilmington 
about 1738. Both are referred to as merchants and tavern keepers. In 1741, 
Thomas advertises a property on Market Street in Wilmington to rent, and in1745, 
there is a record of him assigning a servant girl to someone else.</span></p>
<p><span lang="en-us">
<img border="0" src="images/OldSwedesInsideSm.jpg" width="275" height="177" align="left">In 1730, John Hannum died, naming Thomas as one of his 
executors and leaving £10 to daughter &quot;Elizabeth wife of Thomas Broom&quot;. Elizabeth's mother's will, 
written in 1737 and proved in 1742, mentions &quot;Elizabeth Broom&quot;, leaving her a 
gold ring. She also leaves £5 to granddaughter Mary Broom. Various other 
grandchildren are named, but only one grandchild per child is mentioned, 
generally the oldest. This fits with what is known of Thomas &amp; Elizabeth's 
children.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span lang="en-us">Thomas Broom &amp; Elizabeth Hannum's children<img border="0" src="DSC02430sm.jpg" width="200" height="262" align="right" vspace="10"></span></h3>
<p><span lang="en-us">There are only two frequently quoted birth records for the 
children of Thomas and Elizabeth, although it is clear from Quaker records of 
the Philadelphia Monthly Meeting listing burials of &quot;persons not Friends&quot; and 
from the settlement of Thomas' estate that the Brooms had many more children. 
The two birth records are for a John in 1713 and Mary in 1714. The burial 
records include Thomas, Margrett and John between 1716 and 1730. John's death 
would make Mary the oldest grandchild at the time Margery Southery Hannum made 
her will. Sarah died in 
1732, and her tombstone is preserved in the foundation of a later Hannum 
residence. </span></p>
<p><span lang="en-us">Thomas and his wife Elizabeth Hannum both died in the Fall 
or early Winter of 1749 according for bills found with their estate documents. 
It would appear that his daughter Elizabeth also died around the same time, 
perhaps&nbsp; a few weeks later. The estate settlement divides the property of 
all three of them among the surviving children and grandchildren. The settlement 
of Thomas' estate names James in the position that probably indicates the eldest 
child, and also John (the second one), who is probably a minor at the time (1752), as his share 
is left in James' care. This also fits with the death record of John I in 1730 
and the birth record of John's daughter in 1766. The elder John would have been 
53 at the time. Son James is executor. Further, Robert Broom and three sons 
in law&nbsp; are mentioned, who were married to daughters Ann, Hannah and Mary.</span></p>
<p><span lang="en-us">This gives a total of 11 children, of whom 7 lived to 
adulthood and 6 had children of their own. Some references show a William as a 
son, but I tend to think this is a collateral line, since no William is 
mentioned in any record relating to Thomas, including the settlement of his 
estate, and the name does not show up in later generations of the known 
descendants, unlike the names of other aunts and uncles. </span></p>
