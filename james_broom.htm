<h2>James Broom &amp; Esther Willis</h2>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: Verdana">James Broom 
was the 
son of Thomas Broom &amp; Elizabeth Hannum. He 
and his wife Esther Willis were the parents of Jacob Broom. Both remain mysteries to some extent, even though we 
have a 
fairly good paper-trail for James. There is also quite a bit of conflicting 
and/or incorrect information in LDS and other internet records floating around, 
to add to the confusion. So what do we 
really know?</span></p>
<h3><span lang="EN-GB">When and where was James Broom born &amp; was there a 
relationship to Daniel Broom as some have claimed?</span><img border="0" src="images/gilpinsMillBrandywineSm.jpg" width="275" height="171" align="right" vspace="15"></h3>
<p align="right"><font size="1">Painting attributed to Thomas Doughty (1793-1856),
</font>
<span style="FONT-STYLE: italic"><font size="1">Gilpin's Mill on the Brandywine</font></span></p>
<p align="left">
<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: Verdana">I have never 
seen a birth record for James. In fact, there seem to be only two birth records 
for children of Thomas Broom, despite the fact that we know from both burial 
records and the settlement of Thomas’ estate that he had several more 
children. 
What we do have are the Monthly Meeting Minutes documenting James' marriage to 
Esther in about 1740 and James' mother in law's will, written in 1743, naming 
daughter Esther Broom and grandson John Broom. This would place James' birth date at or 
before 1720. It is at this point that one of the most quoted mistakes becomes 
extremely unlikely: the LDS record stating that Daniel Broom and Judith Calvert’s son 
James, born in 1726, was Jacob Broom’s father. It is not likely that this James 
married at age 14 and had a child at age 15 or 16. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: Verdana">In addition, 
the Chester Monthly Meeting minutes, which also show the marriage of Daniel (in 
one reference named David) and Judith Calvert in 1725 and the birth of their 
children, also show a James Broom, presumably the child of Daniel &amp; Judith, 
&quot;marrying out&quot; in 1756, long after &quot;our James&quot; was married to Esther Willis and 
living in Wilmington. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: Verdana">
What is interesting about the naming patterns of Judith &amp; Daniel's children is 
that the first son was not named after either grandfather (Daniel Sr. and John 
Calvert), but named James. The first daughter was named Mary. James and Mary 
Broom were two other Brooms in the area who had died young, in 1719 and 1721, 
not long after their marriage in 1713. And of course, we have Thomas &amp; 
Elizabeth's children James and Mary who had also been born some 10 years before 
Daniel's children. Their third child was named Daniel and the last two, twins, 
were named Thomas &amp; Elizabeth, the first names of our James' parents. Could be 
coincidence, but could also indicate some more distant family relationship. It 
is presumably this third-generation Daniel who is &quot;reported&quot; for fighting, 
keeping loose company and neglecting meetings&quot; in the Chester Monthly Meeting 
minutes of 1759 and for &quot;drinking to excess and swearing&quot; in 1760. In 1766 and 
1771, there are bills settled for &quot;maintenance&quot; of Judith Broom, suggesting that 
husband Daniel had died before that time. In 1772, it was her son Thomas' turn 
to be reported for Drinking and neglecting meetings. These records indicate that 
the Daniel Broom - Judith Calvert family remained in the Chester area and 
members of the Friends at least through the mid-1770's, while our Brooms removed 
to Wilmington in the late 1730's and early 1740's. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: Verdana">
Additional evidence for Thomas &amp; Elizabeth as James' parents is the land in 
Wilmington which is passed from Thomas Broom &amp; Elizabeth Hannum to son James, 
and which James in turn passes on to his children, including Jacob. I have found 
no records and no will for Daniel Broom Sr., Jr. or III, or their children in Wilmington.&nbsp; 
&quot;Our&quot; 
James’ children carry on various family names, including Thomas &amp; Elizabeth, 
never naming a child Daniel or Judith. </span></p>
<h3>
<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Arial"><font color="#C2460A">Birth date 
for James Broom</font></span></h3>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: Verdana">
<img border="0" src="E-Mumford-CoachofHorses1694.jpg" width="300" height="214" align="left">We also have 
a record of the <u>Original Settlers on the Delaware</u>, in which James is 
listed as being 81 in 1794, also given as the year of his death. His residence 
is shown as Christiana Hundred. It looks as if James’ will was written in 1791, 
although this part of the document is smudged and circumstantial evidence would 
seem to suggest otherwise. Of course, not all wills were made at the time of 
death. The will was probated in 1794, which matches with the 
death date given on the list. The will also includes names of grandchildren born 
<i>after</i> 1791 and before 1794. There were no other Brooms in this area, so this 
is almost certainly “our” James. More likely than not, the 1794 year of death is also 
correct, since the list was made in that same year. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: Verdana">But what 
about his age? Thomas &amp; Elizabeth married at the end of 1711 and have a child 
named John recorded in the summer of 1713. This would make it a tight squeeze to 
have had a child in between. There are (at least) four possibilities: the age on the list is incorrect, 
the baptism record for John, born in 1713 was really James, the baptism of John 
took place a few months after his birth, and James was born shortly thereafter 
but not recorded for some reason, or James was born before John in 1712. According to a historian I had consulted on 
similar situation in another branch of the family, if Elizabeth had been 
pregnant at the time of her marriage, the child would quite likely have no 
baptism record, as that would highlight the fact that the mother was 
pregnant at the time of her marriage. This was apparently 
not uncommon in those days. In this case, his most likely date of birth is the 
summer or early autumn of 1712, and this fits a death at 81 in 1794 perfectly.
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: Verdana">On the other 
hand, it is also possible that James was Thomas &amp; Elizabeth's third child, in 
that case born between 1715 and 1718. If so, the age of 81 was not correct. 
Thomas’ first recorded son, John, apparently died in 1730, leaving James as the eldest son at the 
time of Thomas’ death in 1749, no matter what the original birth order had been. 
This seems to be borne out by Thomas' will.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: Verdana">Thomas paid 
taxes in both Darby and Concord in 1715. Since Thomas moved to Wilmington 
somewhere between 1728 and 1736, and the early children are both baptised and 
buried in Chester through at least the year 1732, it is fairly certain that James was 
born in Chester. </span></p>
<h3><span lang="EN-GB">Who were James’ and Esther’s children?<img border="0" src="blacksmith.jpg" width="273" height="175" align="right" vspace="15"></span></h3>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: Verdana">Here we have 
another problem. Although there is no dispute about Abraham and Jacob, this is 
not the whole story. The conclusion that James and Esther only had two children has probably become prevalent because James 
leaves his estate to those two sons and names no other children or grandchildren 
who cannot be traced to these two. Making Jacob the first child also fit better 
to the Daniel Broom/Judith Calvert 
story, since that James would have been 25 or so when Jacob was born.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: Verdana">However, we have 
the Quaker record and Esther Willis’ mother’s will which seem to prove that 
James and Esther married in 1740. The will also shows&nbsp;that they had a son 
John, most likely still alive in 1743. After that, there would seem to be a 10 year pause before 
Jacob and Abraham are born. This is unlikely in this period of history. 
However, biographies of Jacob make no mention of siblings other than Abraham and James' will mentions no other children.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 11pt" lang="en-gb">Looking further</span><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: Verdana">, 
we find a mysterious reference in the will of Jacob Taylor “Nayler”, 
written in December 1759. In it, he names “friends Esther, Jacob, Isaac and 
Abraham Broom” and makes James Broom and David Bush Jr. executors. David Bush 
was a nephew of James', his mother being James’ sister Ann. This connection adds 
to the evidence that James was Thomas Broom’s son. The Esther named in the will 
could either be mother Esther or a daughter named Esther. Isaac is interesting 
in that it certainly fits the biblical naming pattern of the children. However, 
there is no Isaac in James’ will or in subsequent generations. However, Isaac 
Taylor was Jacob Taylor’s father or grandfather, and his name is associated with 
the Brooms several times over the years. Interestingly, an Isaac Grantham signs 
a bond relating to James Broom’s estate, together with Jacob and Abraham. An 
Isaac Broom does show up in the Bucks Co. census in 1790, but it is not clear if 
there is a relationship and he or his children are not mentioned in James' will.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: Verdana">
A cautious 
conclusion is that there was indeed at least one child in addition to Jacob and 
Abraham (John). There may have been more, including Isaac and possibly Esther, and 
perhaps unsuccessful pregnancies -- or children who died very young -- in between. 
Considering normal naming patterns to which Esther and James seemed to adhere by 
naming their first son John, one would have expected a Mary, Thomas and 
Elizabeth before starting on more arbitrary names like Jacob and Abraham. Jacob 
Way was James' uncle, and another Jacob Way a cousin, which may account for 
Jacob's name. It is fairly certain that none of the other 
children lived long enough to have families of their own. However, there is also a slight 
chance that the Isaac Broom of Bucks Co. is somehow related, but due to a falling out 
in the family, was excluded from James’ will. However, I tend to doubt this.</span></p>
<h3><span lang="EN-GB">And what happened to Esther Willis?</span></h3>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: Verdana">Also a 
mystery here. There seems to be no doubt in any ones' mind that James Broom and Esther Willis were 
the parents of Jacob and Abraham. Esther Willis was the daughter of John Willis 
and Mary Webb, and granddaughter of Esther Brinton, for whom she was named. The 
Brinton and Willis families were active members of the Society of Friends. It is 
also fairly certain that Esther held to her family’s Quaker beliefs longer than 
the rest of the Broom family, up until her marriage. This idea is supported by 
the notations inn the Concord Monthly Meeting minutes, disowning Esther for her 
marriage by a priest. Despite her marriage by a priest, she may have been 
uncomfortable with this and this may explain the lack of 
birth records for her children, or records from this period may simply have been 
lost.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: Verdana">
Unfortunately, both the Campbell biography of Jacob Broom and the John Hill 
Martin’s <u>History of Chester County</u> contain numerous, proven errors and 
shed no light on what happened to Esther. Both Jacob and Abraham named one of 
their daughters after Esther, even including her surname Willis in both cases, which leaves 
little room for doubt about the name of their mother. Abraham was born around 
1755 and Esther was most likely alive at the time of the Taylor will in 1759. 
She is not mentioned in the will of her husband in 1791, so this would place her 
death somewhere between 1760 and 1790.</span></p>
<h3><span lang="EN-GB">What more do we know about James?</span></h3>
<p><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: Verdana">The 
Campbell biography refers to James as “originally a blacksmith”. However, I have 
not found any documentation to support this except an ad placed in “The 
Pennsylvania Gazette” October 23, 1760 which states as an afterthought: “</span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: Verdana">N.B. 
Said James Broom is removed from his late Dwelling house, to a three Story 
House, below the lower Market house, at the Sign of the Sloop, where he 
continues to keep Entertainment for Man and Horse, as usual, and requests his 
Friends, and others, to favour him with their Custom, which will oblige their 
humble Servant. JAMES BROOM.” Presumably the &quot;entertainment for horse&quot; included 
fitting the horses with shoes if necessary, and it is certainly possible that 
James learned this trade during his period of apprenticeship.</span></p>
<p>
<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: Verdana">
<a href="Wilmington1772-without.jpg">
<img border="0" src="Wilmington1772-withoutsm.jpg" width="350" height="276" align="left" hspace="10"></a></span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: Verdana">James’ 
name appears several times in the </span>
<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: Verdana">Pennsylvania 
Gazette between 1750 and 1771, for varying reasons. The early ads concern the 
sale of Thomas Broom’s property, most likely including the tavern referred to in 
the text above. Several ads concern the sale of various pieces of real estate, 
one concerns a horse he has found, and others concern a horse that was stolen 
from him, a servant who has run away and a character reference for a friend who 
is apparently being unjustly accused of fraud. </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: Verdana">James 
wrote his will in 1791, <u>if</u> the date has been read correctly. Even 
magnifying the word really doesn’t give a clear answer. The will was probated in 
September of 1794. However, the will mentions several of Abraham’s children by 
name, including Harriet Rumsey Broom. Her obituary clearly places her birth 
between March 1792 and February 1793, which, in combination with the list of 
from <u>Original Settlers on the Delaware</u> giving James' date of death as 1794, 
makes it much more likely that the real death date was July 1794, and not 1791. </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: Verdana">What 
is certain is that at the time of his death, James possessed quite an inventory 
of property and sufficient funds to leave sizable bequests to his two surviving 
children and grandchildren. Interestingly, only the two oldest of Jacob’s 
children are mentioned. Four of Abraham’s children are mentioned, all of the 
children who had been born 
prior to 1794. </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: Verdana">The instructions regarding Abraham’s legacy are also much more 
specific, something carried on in Jacob’s will, where he also includes bequests 
to Abraham and his children. James leaves Jacob a house and some property 
located on Market Street between Front and Second St., and next to the house &amp; 
property where James was living at the time he made his will. The will indicates 
that Jacob was living in that house. Abraham's portion is willed directly to his 
children, with the provision that Abraham could make use of the income out of 
the property to &quot;educate and maintain&quot; the children until they were of age. </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: Verdana">Jacob was a successful merchant, politician and 
property owner by the time of James’ death, while Abraham was a military 
officer and had quite possibly amassed fewer worldly goods during his career to 
that point. It is quite possible that these differences in status and occupation 
were the source of the differences in the bequests. Since James lived to such a 
comparatively old age for that time, Jacob and Abraham were already forty plus 
when their father died and fairly well taken care of themselves. Although it is difficult to 
determine the exact size of James' estate without having an exact inventory, it 
would appear that he left significantly more to his children and grandchildren that he had 
originally received from his father, suggesting an active and successful working 
life.</span></p>
