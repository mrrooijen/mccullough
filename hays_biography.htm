<p>Excerpt from the Hays biography regarding James &amp; Margaret Blain <i><b>(attention: 
this information has been proven incorrect regarding the parents of James Blain).</b></i></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">&quot;Mr. Hays is connected with other families whose names 
have been prominent in the history of Pennsylvania, the Blaines, McKees, 
Fosters, Galbraiths and Chambers all having borne their part in the activities 
of the early days in the Commonwealth. His grandmother, Margaret (Blaine) McKee, 
was a daughter of James and Deborah (Baird) Blaine, and a cousin of Hon. James 
G. Blaine.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">Col. Ephraim Blaine, who was the great-grandfather of 
James G. Blaine, was born in Ireland in 1744, and was but one year old when, in 
1745, his parents brought him to America, the family settling in Cumberland 
county, Pa., at or near Carlisle. He had two brothers and one sister, Alexander 
(who had two children, Mary and Elizabeth), William (who had three children, 
Isabella, Alexander T. and Ephraim) and Ellen (married Col. Samuel Lyon). The 
name of Ephraim Blaine appears in the list of men residing at Fort Pitt July 22, 
1760. He became one of the prominent citizens of his region, serving his county 
and country with honor and fidelity. In 1771 he was sheriff of Cumberland 
county. In the earlier years of the Revolution he was a resident of Carlisle.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">Ephraim Blaine died at Carlisle in 1804 (in 1808 according 
to the new American Encyclopedia). He and his first wife Rebecca (Galbraith) are 
buried at the Meetinghouse Springs Church (of which they were members), on 
Yellow Breeches creek, about one and a half miles from Carlisle, Pa. The site of 
Colonel Blaine’s old home is near by, and he had a distillery on the creek. His 
second wife was Mrs. Duncan, widow of Judge Duncan. He had two children, both 
born to his first marriage, James and Robert, the former marrying Margaret Lyon 
(their son Ephraim was the father of James G. Blaine).</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">Robert Blaine, son of Ephraim and Rebecca (Galbraith), 
lived in Washington county, Pa. He married Anna Susan Metzgar, and had the 
following children: ... (6) James married Deborah Baird. <font size="2">(This 
record of Robert Blaine and his family is taken from a “Family Memorial” 
published in 1867, containing “fragments of family and contemporary history”, 
and some records of the Robinson, McCord and Blaine families).</font></span></p>
