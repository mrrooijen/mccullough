<h2><span lang="en-us">The Broom Family<img border="0" src="PennyPotTavernunknown1694ss.jpg" width="291" height="188" align="right"> </span></h2>
<p><span lang="en-us">Our branch of the Broom family in America can count 
themselves among the first settlers of the Chester/Delaware area, with records 
dating back to the mid-1680's. They also belong to the founders of Wilmington, 
Delaware in the 1730's. The earliest Broom for whom we have a 
definite, proven record  was <a href="thomas_broom.htm">Thomas Broom</a>, married to Elizabeth Hannum.  
Their son <a href="james_broom.htm">James Broom</a> married Esther Willis. 
James and Esther were the parents of <a href="Jacob_Broom.htm">Jacob Broom</a>, 
a man of many talents who was also active in Delaware politics and a delegate to 
the Constitutional Convention from that state.</span></p>

<img border="0" src="1740eastburnwith_small.jpg" xthumbnail-orig-image="1740eastburnwith.jpg" align="left" vspace="-20" style="float: left"></a>While we are not yet sure if Thomas 
Broom was born in America or 
immigrated around 1700, his wife's  ancestors 
(Hannum, Southery) were among the earliest settlers of Chester County in the mid 1680's. Esther 
Willis' ancestors (Brinton, Webb) were even earlier, some settling first in NY 
(Willis), before moving to SE 
Pennsylvania. Via the tabs at left, you can take a journey through the lives of 
the first three generations of Broom men in America, together with their wives 
and their families.  I've also tried to describe points of contention, 
unsolved mysteries and also some of the (unfortunately) widely published 
misconceptions on  some points of their history. </span></p>

<h3><span lang="en-gb">Why all the interest in the Broom family?</span></h3>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="color: #280D0D">
I</span><span lang="EN-GB" style="color: #280D0D">n 
our family, the Broom family line is perhaps the line whose history has been kept alive 
the most.  Many years ago, when my grandfather discovered that I was 
interested in family history, he pushed a folder of worn, yellowed papers into 
my hands, instructing me to read them carefully. Grandfather was the grandson of 
Jacob Broom Lyon, who in turn, was Jacob Broom's grandson. </span><span lang="EN-GB" style="color: #280D0D">
After a pause of 
several decades and a journey across the ocean, I picked up the papers again and 
started doing some serious research.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="en-gb">
<a name="map of chester" href="delcountycombinedwith2.jpg">
<img border="0" src="delcountycombinedwiththumb.jpg" width="300" height="238" align="right"></a>The Broom history is not only 
interesting because of the role Jacob Broom played in the history of Delaware 
and the US, but also because it is in some ways typical of the lives and paths 
of the earliest settlers of the Chester Co./Delaware Co. area of Pennsylvania, 
many of whom moved to Delaware. 
Within a span of just 50 years or so, the settlers went from living in crude 
shelters and rudimentary log cabins, depending on friendly Indians for help, to 
having built the first cities and the accompanying infrastructure. Many members of this family were 
prominent in business and some also played a part in national and local 
government.  Because of this, more documents have been preserved, including letters written 
over 200 years ago.  From these, it is possible to form a better picture of 
life in that time and the personalities involved, making  the Broom history  
slightly more that a summary of names and dates.</span></p>

the old Chester maps <i><font size="2">(above right, and left)</font></i>, I 
have marked locations of various people (or their ancestors) who were related to 
the Broom family in some way, or who are suspected to be related.  I have 
used colors to make distinctions among the various families, in the hope that 
residence patterns and friends/associates mentioned in various documents will give a clue about Thomas' ancestors and 
relationships. First results would seem to indicate a closer relationship with 
John Broom than with Daniel Broom, for instance, although naming Daniel Broom as 
the grandfather of Jacob Broom is perhaps the most widely spread fiction on 
internet. </span></p>

When I started this research</span><span lang="EN-GB" style="color: #280D0D">, 
I was delighted with any and all scraps of information I could find. Since then, 
my research skills have progressed and, in part thanks to Internet which has 
made worldwide collaboration possible, it has become clear that among the wealth 
of correct information on the Broom family, including Jacob Broom and his 
descendants, there has been quite a bit of misinformation published.  While 
I don't pretend to have all the answers, I hope that the information on the 
Broom family and on Jacob Broom in particular will provide some new insights and 
also correct a few misconceptions. In turn, if you find anything here that <i>
you</i> think is incorrect -- or you have any information to add, I'd really 
appreciate hearing from you.
